# Project---Hangman 
This is a basic hangman game. It has three levels from which the user can choose from:
EASY - word has 3-5 letters
MEDIUM - word has 6-8 letters
HARD - word has 9-12 letters
The game will end once the user has either guessed all the letters of the word randomly chosen by the program or if the user enters 6 incorrect guesses.
The correct and incorrect guesses will be displayed everytime to help the user to keep track of the guesses they have entered.
The hangman will be displayed when the user enters an incorrect guess.
